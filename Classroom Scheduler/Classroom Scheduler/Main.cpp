//R classrooms
//K time slots
//N courses
//M students, each taking courses
//Students as a list of lists of course numbers
//
//We require an answer: for each course, {room, time slot} = {r,k} 

//A constraint graph representing the courses is created,
//For each student's course list, the pairs of courses are enumerated.
//For each pair, an edge between two courses is added to the constraint graph 
//We attempt to K-colour the graph, such that there are no more than R nodes of each colour
//If successful, the r^th node of colour k is scheduled at {r,k}
